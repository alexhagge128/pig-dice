# Pig Dice


## Description

This is an app made with vanilla JS and JQuery replicating the Pig Dice game. Two players will click a dice button to generate a fake dice that will return six integers. The players will take turns rolling the dice. A player can continue rolling and adding points to their total score until they roll a 1, then they lose all points rolled for that turn. They can also choose to "hold", which will add the points accumulated for that round to their total and end their turn. First to roll to a hundred wins.


## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Git clone repo
* Drag html file into working browser
* Start game


## Known Bugs

The prompt that should called once the totalScore is checked to be >= 100 for each player does not work, so the game can continue for eternity...
